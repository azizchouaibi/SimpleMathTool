Simple Math tool is a calculator i built using QT Creator and C++. I built this withing the first week of learning the language just to practice the basics.
This app includes finding the roots ( x' and x") for a second degree equation. Just type a , b and c . It only solves in R and doesnt find complex roots.
You can Also use it to convert a number from Decimal to binary or vice versa. You can find the GCM and LCM of any two numbers ( PGCD and PPCM in french).
And ofcourse you can do basic arithmetic operations.
